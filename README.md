I just published “Implementing the rules of 3 Man Chess: Variant ‘In The Round’. Part 1, Fundamental Types Of Fundamental Values”. Hoping for project collaborators, especially longing for them during the next few hours. Bad pilot for new series. #3manchess #haskell https://medium.com/@ArchieT/implementing-the-rules-of-3-man-chess-variant-in-the-round-94bceae848c6
